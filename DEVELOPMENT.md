# Project Summary

I will write an openFrameworks implementation of Halfbrick's classic game: Fruit Ninja, with an extra twist. First, I will
finish the game mechanics, which would allow the player to slice through "fruits" and gain points. Then, I will attempt to
leverage ofxOpenCV to allow the player to slice the on-screen fruits with their fingers. Lastly, time permitting, I will
improve the game graphics and create a start/end screen.
